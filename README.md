### Projects

- **Attention-Based Clinical Data Analysis:** Implemented cutting-edge methodology for clinical time series data using masked self-attention, positional encoding, and dense interpolation, outperforming LSTM and logistic regression models with up to 5% improvement in prediction accuracy on MIMIC-III datasets.
- **Semantic-Based Recommendation Model:** Leveraged the Amazon Fine Foods review dataset to create a sophisticated recommendation system. Transformed textual data into an embedding space, extracting nuanced semantic meanings through the distilroBERTa model. These embeddings were then utilized as inputs for a Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations provided.
